# odin-recipes
A very basic recipe website as my first HTML project through 'The Odin Project' designed to help me demonstrate the abilities that have been covered so far.

So far we have covered lists (ordered and unordered), links (relative and absolute), images, elements, attributes, HTML Boilerplates, nesting, comments, etc.
