      <h3>
        <p>A yummy dish that few people have ever heard about save for an obscure episode of Maury that seems to have been forgotten about. "Chicken Tetrazzini" was an often used inside joke between my friend Ty, who showed me the episode, and I and usually left people confused because "What's Chicken Tetrazzini?"</p>
        <p>Fast forward an eternity and I've finally eaten Chicken Tetrazzini. This is an easy peasy recipe for a seriously underrated pasta dish. This dish is sure to win over a few hearts! ;D </p>
